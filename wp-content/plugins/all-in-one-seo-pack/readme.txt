=== ‚ú® Optimize Your Pages for Higher SEO Rankings with TruSEO Analysis ===

Creating SEO optimized content used to be hard. Why?

Because most business owners aren't SEO experts. 

That's why we created the TruSEO score. This gives you a more in-depth SEO optimization analysis and an actionable SEO checklist, so you can easily optimize your website pages for any keyword to get higher SEO rankings and maximum traffic.

Our SEO content analysis tool is enabled by default in both the Gutenberg block editor and Classic Editor, so you can quickly optimize your blog posts and pages for your SEO keywords to get higher SEO rankings.

Our SEO readability analysis gives you further insights on how to improve your content for maximum SEO benefits.

The best part about TruSEO analysis is that you can use it to optimize your posts / pages for unlimited SEO keywords.

=== ‚ú® Seamless SEO Integrations with Webmaster Tools & Social Media ===

All in One SEO for WordPress offers seamless integration with popular social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, and more.

> Joel Steinmann

=== ‚ú® Smart XML Sitemaps and Rich Snippets (SEO Schema Markup) ===

Proper website SEO markup plays an important role in improving SEO rankings. That's why smart SEO experts use AIOSEO for on-page SEO optimization. An XML sitemap is a list of all the content on your website. The sitemap helps search engine bots to easily see all the content on your site in one place, The XML sitemap file is hidden from your human visitors, however search engines like Google can see it. Without an XML sitemap, some of your web pages may never be included in Google search results, and won't get any traffic. XML Sitemaps also help you tell Google which pages you DON'T want included in search results.

Aside from the comprehensive WordPress XML sitemap feature, we also offer News SEO sitemap and Video SEO sitemap to help you improve your website's SEO ranking and get more traffic.

AIOSEO comes with built-in smart SEO schema markup feature to help you get more traffic through SEO rich snippets, Google featured snippets, breadcrumb site links in SEO, and image SEO search results.

We also include an easy to use Next-Gen Schema Generator to output tons of custom schema for events, job postings, recipes, how-tos, software applications, products and so much more!

> The best SEO plugin. All in One SEO is the best SEO Plugin. I personally find it better than Yoast. This plugin offers so much freedom in configuration.<br>
