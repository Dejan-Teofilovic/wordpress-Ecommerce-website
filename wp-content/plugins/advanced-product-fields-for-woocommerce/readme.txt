Advaced Product Fields (Product Addons) allows you to add extra product options (form input fields) to your WooCommerce product pages. Whether you want to create a pizza configurator or add extra options, this plugin has got you covered!

Allow customers to personalize their product with a handful of extra choices, fields, etc... These options can increase the final product price too. The extra form data submitted by the customer will be shown on the cart and checkout pages and will be saved on the backend order.

<strong>üëâ How can our plugin be useful and what should you use it for?</strong>

WooCommerce only has limited features to display extra product options on your product pages. You can use their "variable products" which can add a few select (dropdown) lists to a product.

But what if you're selling customizable t-shirts where customers can print their name on a t-shirt? Or what if you'd like your customers to build their own pizza where they can freely choose extra toppings?
These product types can't be built with WooCommerce out-of-the-box. That's where our plugin comes in. It allows you to build more complex WooCommerce products that can easily be personalized by your customer.

When should you use WooCommerce built-in variations versus our plugin? We wrote [a handy blog post](https://www.studiowombat.com/blog/when-to-use-a-plugin-for-product-options-in-woocommerce-versus-variations/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme) to answer that question.

== üëâÔ∏è  What makes our plugin different from the competition? ==

During your research, you may have seen other plugins that do (more or less) the same. Here is how we are different:

‚úÖÔ∏è  Our plugin is younger than the competition. It does not have to support older WooCommerce or WordPress versions, so you benefit from modern code.
‚úÖÔ∏è  Quality above quantity. We carefully choose what & how we implement features so the plugin remains lightweight and fast.
‚úÖÔ∏è  The plugin's frontend scripts are tiny (~7kb) and doesn't impact your SEO score.
‚úÖÔ∏è  Easy-to-use modern backend which follows WordPress & WooCommerce standards.
‚úÖÔ∏è  Regular updates to stay on top of new WordPress & WooCommerce versions.
‚úÖÔ∏è  Our plugin runs fewer database queries because we've spent time optimizing how data is stored.

We understand these statements are meaningless without <strong>additional proof</strong> to back them up, so here are a few links to help make up your mind:
